For this website there are php files,css files.The CSS files were mainly for styling.
to run ,you must have a local server (XAMPP ) in this case.The register.php file should run first allowing the user to register and adding their details to thedatabase.The user will then be re directed to a page dashboard.php where they can login using the login.php page.
all these operations are facilitated by the server using the code in the files index.php,database.php and user.php
